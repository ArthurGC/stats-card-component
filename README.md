### What I learned

I had to use a relative unit **ch** for customize width of some texts.

```css
.card_text_p{
  width: 40ch;
}
```
Besides, **SASS** simplifies the use of variables for fonts, font sizes and colors, 

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36679649/how-to-add-a-color-overlay-to-a-background-image/36679903) - This helped me for combinning a background image url and a background color:

```css
.card_img {
  background-image: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(170, 92, 219, 0.8), rgba(170, 92, 219, 0.8)), url(/images/image-header-mobile.jpg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  background-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

- [Resource 2](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the advantages of using sass.
